# Carbonated-Drinks-Production-Line
The main idea of a carbonated water production line is to efficiently and consistently  produce carbonated water, which is water that has been infused with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas  to create bubbles and a fizzy texture. So here we program a chip to control that production line,  Hence the production line typically involves several key steps:

## Sequence and steps:
#### 1- Start: The starting point of the carbonated drinks production process, where all valves 
are closed.
#### 2- Adding ingredients: first we add water until it reaches a certain level, then we add 
sweeteners for certain time Ti1, then flavor for Ti2 and last, we add other additives for 
Ti3.
#### 3- Ingredients Mixing: Mixing and blending the various ingredients, including water, 
sweeteners, flavors, and other additives for Ti4.
#### 4- Carbonation: Introducing carbon dioxide into the mixture for certain time Ti5 to create 
the characteristic fizziness.
#### 5- Bottling: Transferring the carbonated beverage into bottles then cover the bottles.
#### 6- Labeling: Applying labels with product information and branding to the bottles.
#### 7- Packaging: Packaging the bottles into cases or other packaging formats suitable for 
distribution, by iterating on steps 5 and 6 until the bottles number is equal to 12.
#### 8- Finished Product: The result of the production process, ready for distribution and 
consumption.
#### 9- Work for ever: This action (production process) will be repeated if the automatic is set.
#### 10- End: The end of the carbonated drinks production process.
